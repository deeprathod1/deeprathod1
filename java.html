    <h1>JAVA SCRIPT</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes,</p>

            <td>To create the variables we will use one of the 3 keywords and they are: “var”, “let” and “const”. One of the first things you should know about these 3 keywords is that until 2015, only the “var” keyword was used and the “let” and “const” keywords were introduced with a JavaScript standard called ES6 or ES2015 </td>

            <td > Control structures / Control statements enable a programmer to determine the order in which program statements are executed. These control structures allow you to do two things: 1) skip some statements while executing others, and 2) repeat one or more statements while some condition is true.</td>
